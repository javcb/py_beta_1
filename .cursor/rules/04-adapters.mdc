description: Wrapping third-party libraries cleanly.
globs:
  - "src/adapters/**"
---

# Purpose
- Provide integration code for approved libraries and unify their APIs with our components.

# Allowed Libraries (baseline)
- radix-ui primitives, @tanstack/react-table, @tremor/react, react-day-picker,
  react-pdf or react-pdf-viewer, @stripe/react-stripe-js.
- If another library is required, **propose** it first and explain compatibility.

# Rules
- Do not export symbols from `adapters/*` outside of `src/components/**`.
- Keep any external CSS imports **co-located** here and ensure they load **before** Tailwind utilities.
- Convert library props to **our** props at the component boundary.
- No global styles; no mutation of vendor kit CSS.

# Examples
- Date picker logic -> `adapters/day-picker/CalendarBase.tsx`
- Public component -> `components/forms/DatePicker/DatePicker.tsx` wraps CalendarBase
