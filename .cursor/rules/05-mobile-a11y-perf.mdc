# Mobile-first
- Base styles = mobile; scale up with breakpoints.
- Avoid horizontal scroll on mobile; prefer stacking + `gap-*`.
- Touch targets â‰¥ 40px; avoid tiny hit areas.

# Accessibility
- All interactive elements reachable by keyboard; visible focus ring using the tokenized ring color.
- Provide `aria-live` for toasts; set `aria-modal="true"` for dialogs.
- Use semantic HTML (buttons as <button/>, links as <a/>).

# Performance
- Keep component bundle small; lazy-load heavy adapters (PDF viewer, charts).
- Avoid re-renders: memoize where appropriate; keep props serializable.
- Use `aria-hidden` and `inert` when offscreen overlays mount for perf.
