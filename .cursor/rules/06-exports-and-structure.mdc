description: Enforce clean public surface and file layout.
globs:
  - "src/**"

# Public Surface
- Only export from `src/index.ts`.
- `src/index.ts` may re-export from `src/components/**` and `src/patterns/**` only.
- Never export anything from `adapters/**`, `internal/**`, or `tokens/**`.

# File Moves/Renames
- Do not move or rename files unless explicitly requested. If needed, propose a plan.

# Storybook Imports
- Stories must import from the package root (`@javcb/ui`) to mimic real usage.
