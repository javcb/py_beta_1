# Protection Rules
- Do **not** modify, move, or delete files matching these globs.
- Changes here require the explicit phrase: **ALLOW PROTECTED EDITS** in the user request.
- If a task necessitates edits, propose:
  1) Why it's needed
  2) Exact files and proposed diffs
  3) Safer alternatives (wrapper/extension) 
  Then wait for approval.

# Vendor Kits
- Treat `src/vendor/**` and `src/kits/**` as **golden copies**. Never fork-edit.
- To customize, create wrappers under `src/components/**` or `src/patterns/**`.
