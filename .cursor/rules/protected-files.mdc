description: Guard canonical files; require explicit approval for edits.
globs:
  - "README.md"                     # protect root README
  - "src/vendor/**"                 # Tailwind Plus location in app
  - "packages/ui/src/tokens/**"
  - "packages/ui/src/adapters/**"
  - "packages/ui/src/index.ts"
rules:
  - Never modify files matching these globs unless the user explicitly writes: ALLOW PROTECTED EDITS.
  - If a change requires touching a protected file, STOP and propose a plan listing exact paths and diffs.
  - Do not rename or move protected files.
  - Prefer additive work: create new files in packages/ui/src/components/** and wire exports.
