# Operating Mode
- Always show a **plan & diff** before editing. Never auto-apply.
- Only modify files explicitly referenced by the user or included with @Files/@Folders.
- If a task requires touching protected paths, STOP and ask for approval (see Protected Files).

# Design Anchor
- Treat **Tailwind Plus** (and our tokens) as the **canonical visual source**.
- Do not invent new colors/spacing/radii/shadows. Use tokens and Tailwind utilities.

# Mobile-first
- Author components **mobile-first**: base styles = mobile; use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` progressively to enhance.
- Avoid fixed widths on core components; prefer fluid layouts and responsive utilities.

# Boundaries
- App code imports **only from `@javcb/ui`**. Never expose or import from `adapters/*` or `internal/*`.
- New 3P UI libs must be wrapped in `adapters/*` and re-exposed as **your** components.

# Deliverables per component change
- Component file(s)
- Storybook story
- Types (Props) with JSDoc
- A11y attributes and keyboard behavior
- Unit test (or at least interaction test for complex components)
