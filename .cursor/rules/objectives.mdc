description: Keep repo goals and quality bars top-of-mind for all edits.
globs:

# Objectives (Always Respect)
- Monorepo with **Plus-free** `@javcb/ui` and Vite app.
- Tailwind Plus assets live **only** under `src/vendor/tailwindplus/**` (app side).
- App code must import UI **only** from `@javcb/ui` public exports.
- Adapters under `packages/ui/src/adapters/**` are **internal** (no re-exports).
- Use Tailwind tokens + utilities for all styling; avoid inline colors.

# Patterns to Prefer
- Additive changes; do not rename/move protected files.
- If an edit requires protected paths, STOP and propose a plan.
- If toggling `PLUS_PUBLISH_PROTECTION=off`, add a clear note in the PR and re-enable after.

# "Good" Quick Check (before proposing diffs)
- No Plus imports in `packages/ui/src/**`
- Tailwind content globs include `packages/ui/src/**/*`
- New components land in `packages/ui/src/components/**` and export from `src/index.ts`
- App examples go to `/ui-demo` or Storybook (when enabled)
